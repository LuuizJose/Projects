**School Dropout Prediction (Churn Prediction)**

  **Project Description**
    This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of student dropout in an educational institution. Predicting dropout can help institutions identify at-risk students and take proactive measures to improve student retention.
    The project was developed using the Scikit-learn library to build and evaluate machine learning models, focusing on classification algorithms and performance metrics.

  **Objectives:**
    Predict which students are at higher risk of dropping out of school.
    Explore different machine learning models to identify the most effective one for this task.
    Implement a data preprocessing pipeline to handle categorical variables, missing values, and normalization.
